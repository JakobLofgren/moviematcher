# MovieMatcher

MovieMatcher is a tool to find movies to watch. It has good tools to filter out what you want to watch and gives you convenient links to decide if the movie is worth watching.

Tools used: 

* ### [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

* ### [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

* ### [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

## How to use:

Take a look at `config.example.js` on how to get & set the API key

## No Redux/MobX/(Insert state-lib here) in 2017? 

Yup, too small of an app to utilize it.
