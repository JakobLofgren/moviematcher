					MovieMatcher was developed by <strong>Jakob LÃ¶fgren</strong>. This project was built as a hobby project.
					MovieMatcher's UI is built with React + React-Router, powered by the API provided by <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TheMovieDB.org</a>.
					I also used <a href="http://react.semantic-ui.com">Semantic-Ui</a> to quickly develop a MVP.

				<Header as="h2">Why</Header>
				<p style={styles.p_styles}>
					I developed this because I always have a hard time picking movies to watch. I'm quite picky (pun) when it comes to movies and
					IMDB's Top list is filled with too many old movies. I want movies from this centuary god damnit.
